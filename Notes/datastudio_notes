- Add source from big query

## Plotting graphs
- Create a time series of data
- Can add controls to limit the date range of the time series plot


## Dimensions and metrics
- Add dimension (how we are grouping the metrics, x-axis) and metrics (what we actually want to count, y-axis)
- If there is a field that we want that do not exist (per month instead of datetime), we can make a field
- Uuse dimension breakdown to further breakdown a dimension (ex. have a data bby month, but would like to specify the year range in which the data is being calculated)

## Metabase is opensource version of datastudio, can run on local postgres
