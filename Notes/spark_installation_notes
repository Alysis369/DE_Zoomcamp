## Installation of spark on VM linux
- spark requires java to operate, download java version 8 or 11 only
- download with wget, extract then add the extracted directory into a variable
- try using the oldest spark, with hadoop 3.2

## Downloadig Java/Spark
wget {insert link into the right spark/java}
tar xzfv {name of the .tgz file} # This extracts the .tgz file

## Adding Java to path

export JAVA_HOME="${HOME}/spark/jdk-11.0.2"
export PATH="${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"

export SPARK_HOME="${HOME}/spark/spark-3.2.4-bin-hadoop3.2"
export PATH="${SPARK_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"

## Adding spark's python library to python path, otherwise python would not be able to import spark
export PYTHONPATH="${SPARK_HOME}/python/:$PYTHONPATH"
export PYTHONPATH="${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/py4j-0.10.9.5-src.zip:$PYTHONPATH"
