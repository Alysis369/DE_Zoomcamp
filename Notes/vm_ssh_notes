# Steps to make VM in general
# Create SSH keys - google create ssh keys gcp
# In GCP --> go to compute engine --> metadata --> add public key there
# Once VM is generated use:

ssh -i ~./ssh/gcp *user name*@*VMhostname*

# Other wise create config

touch config #Create new config

#example ssh config file
Host de-zoomcamp
    HostName *Insert VM IP*
    User alysis *Insert username*
    IdentityFile *Insert location of private key*

less .bashrc # view bashrc
source .bashrc # rerun bashrc

# docker without sudo
sudo groupadd docker
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
sudo service docker restart
source .bashrc #restart .bashrc

# download docker compose
wget *insert link to docker compose* -O docker-compose
mkdir bin # put docker into bin as an executable
chmod +x docker-compose # change the downloaded file into an executable
nano .bashrc #add to path
source .bashrc #restart bash rc

# add following into .bashrc to add bin folder to path
export PATH="${HOME}/bin:${PATH}"

# install terraform
wget *terraform link here*
unzip terraform

# To move files from local to remote using sftp
cd *insert folder path of the key*
sftp de-zoomcamp
mkdir .gc # Keys have to put in .gc folder
put *insert name of key*

# setting up gcp with the new key
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/.gc/*name of key*
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS # authenticate


# terraform cmds
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

# shutdown ssh computer
sudo shutdown now

# Note that next time VM is started, new hostname will be generated for that ssh computer
# Hence need to update config file in .ssh
